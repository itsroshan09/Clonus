## üìñ Project Abstract

Clonus is an innovative health-tech prototype designed to combat the growing issue of lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Many people struggle to understand the slow, cumulative impact of their daily habits on their long-term health. Clonus addresses this by creating a personalized **"Digital Twin"**‚Äîan AI-powered projection of a user's future health.

By inputting their daily lifestyle and health data, users receive a dynamic, visualized health score and a projection of their physical well-being over time. The application features an interactive simulation model that allows users to see how positive changes (like improved sleep or diet) can alter their future health trajectory. Clonus isn't just a predictor; it's a proactive health companion that provides actionable, AI-driven recommendations to empower users to take control of their health today for a better tomorrow.

## üìä Dataset Used

This project does not use any external, pre-existing datasets. For the "Health Trajectory" demonstration featuring the user "Roshan," a **static, pre-assumed dataset** was created within the application's frontend. This dataset was designed to realistically simulate a 10-month health progression based on factors like poor diet and lack of exercise.
